# Fair_Value

The project titled “Fair Value – Buy & Sell Used Cars” is interactive software for managing and dealing with the entire transactions of the business regarding the details of used cars and the customers who wish to buy or sell them.

This project is developed in PYTHON Language with MYSQL for Database handling and mainly focuses on operations like displaying & searching for information regarding a particular car or customer, sales or deals, inserting new data, updating existing information or deleting it. 

Earlier when transactions were maintained through paperwork, there were many problems like data was unsafe as there is always a possibility of loss of papers, too much written work which was hectic, no backup available, etc. But with our software, all the transactions are maintained through “Fair Value – Buy & Sell Used Cars”, it is easy to use attractive user interface where data is safe, existing data can be viewed within seconds, changes can be made easily, backup is available and no burden of handwritten information.
